                <p>My family and I try and get to Disneyland at least three or four times a year. We aim to make it once for an After Dark event (which usually ends up being Star Wars Nite, completely my doing), once over the summer, once over the summer (hot and crowded, that’s when the big events happen, like Pixar Fest last year), and then once for either the Halloween Season (if we’re lucky enough to get tickets for Oogie Boogie Bash) and/or Christmastime.</p>

                </figure>Over the years, we have learned that the least crowded time to enjoy all the Christmas decor, parades, themed food, and rides is after Christmas. This year, we ended up going into the New Year, as Disneyland keeps their Christmas decor up until January 8th. We found it a great way to extend the holiday magic, after all the gift openings, New Year’s Eve celebrations, and after the seventh day of Kwanzaa. </p>

                <p>For our first trip of 2025, we spent two days in Disneyland. Normally we do one day in Disney’s California Adventure, but we weren’t a huge fan of their Festival of the Holidays in 2019, so we wanted to spend extra time doing what we know we’d love.</p>

                </button>                
                
                <p> While there’s so much to do in Disneyland anyway, it’s especially tough to try and cram everything in during the holidays. My family and I made sure to strategize a plan prior to entry to make sure we got everything in. On the top of our list, without a doubt, was to make sure we saw the Christmas Fantasy Parade at least once a day. It’s one of our all time favorite parades and we find it best to watch it during the day (luckily, my mom didn’t mind saving a few seats while my me, my sister, and my dad rode a few more rides).</p>

                <p>One of the reasons we love going over the holidays is because of the few, but epic rides that change completely for the season. Our favorite? The Haunted Mansion: Nightmare Before Christmas Edition. We love it when Jack Skellington ambushes the mansion and decorates in for his rendition of the holidays. Additionally, they changed the queue line for The Haunted Mansion since our last visit, so we were even more excited to see it. </p>
                <p>The other ride we could not miss was Small World, as they also change over everything completely to be holiday themed. It's all lit up with rainbow lights, I always have wondered how Cast Members are able to but up all the holiday decor in one night. There are so many individual bulbs, so many individual animatronics just within that one ride, it’s quite impressive. I don’t normally care to go on Small World, but the holiday touch makes it worth it.</p>

                <p>There was one other ride that was non-negotiable, which was Tiana’s Bayou Adventure. Though this was not holiday themed, this was the first time that we had been in the park after it opened. I was a little hesitant on if I would like it or not (I’ve never been a huge fan of water rides).</p>
                <p>We scheduled our lighting lane for the perfect time: 11pm, as we would be leaving the park right after that (so we wouldn’t be drenched in the cold, still in the park). We were able to walk right on the ride and we thoroughly  enjoyed it.

                <p>The animatronics were amazing, the colors were beautiful, the music and the theme of the ride was entrancing! I loved how they added a new storyline, while still seeing familiar character (I loved it so much I even got a pin with my favorite character on it, Mama Odie to remember my first ride). </p>
                <p>By the end of the trip, we were able to check off everything we wanted to do: got our yummy snacks (like the cream cheese filled pretzel), met all the characters dressed in their holiday costumes, and got to see the Christmas Fantasy Parade twice! One of the best trips to date.
